            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>After studying oriented programming languages in college I turned my focus onto people and communication. I have rediscovered my love of programming and went back toward my passion for web design. I am a full stack developer with experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, third party APIâ€™s and more! In my previous careers I developed expert level customer service skills. I was a flight attendant, a supervisor at starbucks, and an account manager. I have a passion for working with and helping people. I thrive in a team environment where we are able to discuss and expand ideas. I have been obsessed with everything technology since high school when I built my first computer in a computer science class. I have now found a way to turn that hobby into a career through my full stack development bootcamp. I seek a role as a web developer at a company where I can learn, grow, interact, and master my skills.</p>
